The tidy.txt file contains a table with the following data variables:

subjectID -- the code representing each subject who took part of the study

activityID -- a character string from activity_lables.txt key table providing a
descriptive name of the activity the subject undertook.

*-mean()-* -- all variables for which the mean was computed
*-std()-* -- all variables for which the standard deviation was computed

The latter variable names were judged to already have self-explanatory names so
they were not changed for something longer and more readable because of the 
data handling problems longer names might create if, for example, the data file were
imported in Excel. And anything shorter would not have added anything to the
clarity of the data. Therefore, we have decided to respect the original 
choices made by the engineers who performed the study.

Everything else remains aligned with the data provided by the original lab. The
new data set produced is tidy as it respects the rules defining a tidy set and 
to the extent possible:  each variable equals 1 column, each observation is a
different row, the data set of all means is in 1 table, and the table is saved 
1 one file.
